I'm Hrishikesh P a student Game designer and programmer. I'm a sophomore at Amrita College of Engineering.

### As a Game Designer

Making games is my passion and I want to be able to express myself through my games and hope to work on major titles someday. Each day's work is a step forward towards this goal.

#### Tech stack I'm familiar with
* Game Engines: Unreal Engine, Unity
* Programming: Visual Scripting, Unreal Blueprints, C++, Python
* Software: Blender, Maya, Adobe Photoshop, Audacity
* Version Control: Perforce, Git

### As a Programmer

I believe that one of the greatest assets of a game designer is the ability to think like the programmer. The importance of approaching a problem logically and coming up with the most optimum and cost-effective solution can't be stressed enough.

#### Tech stack I'm familiar with
* Languages: C++, Python, Java, JS, Dart
* Frameworks: React, Electron, Flutter.

### Projects

The following are some of the solo projects I've worked on while learning the basics of game development.
