<p>Making games is my passion and I want to be able to express myself through my games and hope to work on major titles someday. Each day’s work is a step forward towards this goal.<br />
I realize that I don’t know everything and I might ‘ve started out late but I recognize my weak points and strive to imporve myself every day.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the greatest assets of a game designer is the ability to think like the programmer. The importance of approaching a problem logically and coming up with the most optimum and cost-effective solution can’t be stressed enough.</p>
